VSMA (Vessel Shipment Management App) - How to Use

The VSMA is designed to help you manage your vessel's cargo shipment manifest data, including voyage details, real-time metrics, and individual shipment records.

1. Vessel and Voyage Details

Start by documenting the key information for the current run.

Locate the fields for header information, usually found at the top of the interface or a dedicated "Voyage Details" section.

Enter the Vessel Name and Voyage Number.

Enter the four critical dates: ETD (Estimated Time of Departure), Allotment Date, Pickup Date, and Handover Date.

2. Reading the Summary Dashboard

The summary dashboard provides a real-time, aggregated view of the manifest data for quick operational oversight.

Total TEUs: This metric displays the total number of Twenty-foot Equivalent Units currently allocated across all shipments listed in the manifest.

Total Tonnage: This displays the cumulative weight (in Tons) of all cargo items that have been added to the manifest.

These summaries update automatically whenever a new shipment is added, deleted, or edited, allowing you to quickly monitor the total load of the vessel.

3. Adding a New Shipment

Use the entry form to log individual cargo items onto the manifest.

Locate the shipment entry form (or "Add Shipment" section).

Fill out the required fields for the new shipment: Consignee/Client Name, Tonnage (Weight), and TEUs Allocated.

Click the "Add Shipment" button to instantly add the item to the manifest table below.

4. Managing and Editing Shipments

All current shipments are listed in the main manifest table.

To Edit: Find the shipment you need to change and click the "Edit" button next to it. Modify the relevant fields (Tonnage, TEUs, etc.) and click "Save" or "Update" to finalize the changes.

To Delete: Click the "Delete" or "Remove" button next to the shipment item you wish to permanently remove from the manifest.

5. Bulk Data Operations (Import/Export)

VSMA supports efficient data transfer via CSV files for quick loading and reporting.

To Import (Load Data): Click the "Import CSV" button, then select the file. The system will process and add the shipments to your manifest.

To Export (Generate Report): Click the "Export CSV" button to download a CSV file containing all current data from the manifest.

6. Backup and Data Management (Copy and Restore)

The VSMA includes essential tools for data integrity and rapid recovery.

Copy Function

The Copy function creates an instant, temporary snapshot of all current manifest data (including Voyage Details and all Shipment Records). This copy is stored locally in your browser's memory and is intended for:

Quick Export: Copying the entire manifest content to paste into an external spreadsheet or document.

Restore Preparation: Serving as the source data for the Restore Backup function, allowing you to save a safe point before major edits.

Restore Backup Function

The Restore Backup function allows you to instantly load manifest data from the last state saved using the Copy function.

Use this function to quickly revert the manifest to the last copied state if accidental changes or deletions occurred.

Important: The restore function only loads the last copied data, so it is recommended to use the Export CSV (Section 5) for long-term, permanent backups.GOOD LUCK!!
